        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Sela was founded in 2021 by a group of university students who recognized the challenges people faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our mission has always been to provide secure and flexible storage solutions to our community. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Since our inception, we have experienced significant growth, driven by our commitment to customer satisfaction and the evolving needs of our clients. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We are excited to announce that we have ongoing plans to build more facilities across the country. Soon, our services will be available nationwide, making it easier for everyone to access safe storage spaces when they need them most.</p>
